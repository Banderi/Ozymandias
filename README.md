# Ozymandias

This is a re-do of an attempt to recreate the engine of *Impression Games*' old City Builder titles _"Pharaoh"_, *"Zeus"* and others in a modern, open-source engine.

If you're looking for the original (discontinued, Pharaoh-focused) project in C++, check out [Banderi/Ozymandias_Julius](https://github.com/Banderi/Ozymandias_Julius) or its third-party continuation, [dalerank/Akhenaten](https://github.com/dalerank/Akhenaten).

This was inspired by the continued effort on the *Caesar 3*'s open-source reimplementations, [bvschaik/Julius](https://github.com/bvschaik/julius) and [Keriew/Augustus](https://github.com/Keriew/augustus).

## Building/running the game

This repository is still early on in development, and the project itself only sports barebones structure and menu logic which are still getting filled. It is currently made with **Godot 3.6 (Mono/.NET)**, which can be downloaded [here](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/3.6-stable/), though it may be switched to a more up-to-date version of the engine at a later time.

It **requires the original game files** to build and to play.
